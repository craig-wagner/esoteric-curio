    Dearest tree,
    
    Bark to heart you grow.
    Uncomfortably askew
    To eyes that fail to see your
    Struggle and the resulting
    Majesty with which it crowned you.
    
    Not my eyes. I see you.
    
    Such a journey. So many of your kind have
    Lost to the uncaring brutality of nature and the
    Small minds of men and their ambition.
    
    Surviving only to provide comfort to the universe
    Untainted by deserved spite. Destined
    To fall and return to Earth.
    
    You are at peace.
    You bring me peace.
    I will deserve it.
    
    TES
