<p>I'm exciting that the <a href="http://www.ufg.br/page.php">Universidade Federal de GoiÃ¡s</a> or Brazil has a course called: "Scalable Architectures for Large Scale Applications" in their Computer Science department.</p><p>What's more?  I'm very honored to learn that they are using <a href="http://scalableinternetarchitectures.com/">my book</a> as a part of their curriculum.  I've added a venue for recruiting <a href="http://omniti.com/is/hiring/site-reliability-engineer">Site Reliability Engineers</a> at <a href="http://omniti.com">OmniTI</a>.</p>
