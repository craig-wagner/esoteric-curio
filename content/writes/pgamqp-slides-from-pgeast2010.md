<p>This past week I had the privilege of presenting along side many distinguished speakers at this year's PostgreSQL Conference East 2010 in Philadelphia, PA.  I presented <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/postwait/postgresql-meet-your-queue">PostgreSQL: meet your queue</a> which was received even more warmly than I had anticipated.  I really think that cueing your database to publish over AMQP is the bees knees and it turns out I wasn't alone!</p>
