<p>For any fans out there, you'll be pleased to know that the speaking circuit is about to pick up again this year.  I should be talking at: </p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2005/EU/index.html">ApacheCon Europe 2005</a> 18-22 July 2005 (in Stuttgart, Germany),</li> <li><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">OSCON 2005</a> 1-5 August 2005 (in Portland, Oregon USA), and</li> <li><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">EuroOSCON 2005</a> 17-20 October 2005 (in Amsterdam, The Netherlands).</li> </ul> <p> At each conference I'll be presenting "<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6412">Scalable Internet Architectures</a>" which goes into the gory details behind building, managing and maintaining large Internet systems.  From policies and procedures to technical topics such as geographically disparate static content serving (building your own CDN), clustered logging, caching architectures, the good and bad of tiered solutions, and data/database replication along with some "stupid pet tricks." </p>  <p> Additionally, at OSCON 2005 in Portland, I'll be giving a first-time presentation on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6390">active, real-time replication from Oracle into MySQL</a>.  What HUGE, ENORMOUS Internet system uses this technology?  Attend and find out.</p>  <p> Those that are interested should make an event of it and attend! </p>
