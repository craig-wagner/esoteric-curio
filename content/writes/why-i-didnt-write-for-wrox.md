Actually, I've only ever been asked that once, but I've been asked countless times why I didn't write for publisher XYZ (O'Reilly, APress, Wrox, etc.).  Well, I suppose I found the best reason of all.  Today <a href="https://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/">George</a> threw together a possible cover for my book in classic "wrox-style."  I liked it so much, I pulled touched it up in Illustrator and have a nice shiny <a href="https://www.omniti.com/~jesus/misc/wrox-knock-scalable.pdf">PDF</a>.  How many people do you think would buy my book if Wrox published it?</p> <p>Watch out, I will eat your head.</p>
