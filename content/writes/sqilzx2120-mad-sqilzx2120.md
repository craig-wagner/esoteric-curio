<p>So, every once in a while I go on a T-shirt kick.  Lisa hates it because I have 10 drawers <b>full</b> of T-shirts at home and then there are those that are in the hamper and in the wash and staged to to be re-drawered.  I have a lot of shirts.  Some are over 15 years old.  Many are from conferences.  They are my little bit of nostalgia.</p>  <p>A couple of us were sitting around listing out the various PostgreSQL services that <a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> provides.  This list is long and needs to go through a bit of marketing massage.  But at the end, I decided it really was just that we have mad SQiLz&#x2120;.</p>  <p>Of course, one cannot reasonably put "Mad SQiLz&#x2120;" on a piece of marketing literature and expect it to go over well.  There is the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing">Guerrilla Marketing</a> and it will fit right in there!</p>  <p>Result?  T-shirts and someone said I should copyright  or trademark SQiLz&#x2120;, However, it better fits as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Mark">service mark</a>.  After all, it is what we do.</p>  <p>Awesome T-shirts design, I'm totally stoked.  I'll be sure to wear mine at OSCON this year -- look for it.</p>
