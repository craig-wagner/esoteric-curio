When I was in high school, I decided I wanted to grow my hair out.  That was 10 years ago.  Since then, my hair has reached to the middle of my back.   My wife, my colleagues, and most of my friends have never seen me with short hair.  <p>I love change.  I can't stand a stagnate landscape.  I need new business, new projects, new problems and the opportunity for new solutions.  Along the lines of change, I have considered cutting my hair for about two years.  However, it is one of the changes that you can't just "try on."  It is a complete commitment.</p>  <p>With the encouragement of my wife, I committed to the scissors on Saturday...  And as my mother put it: "Holy mother of God!"</p>  <center> <img src="http://www.omniti.com/~jesus/misc/transformation.jpg"> </center> <br>
