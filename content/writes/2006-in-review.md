<p>It seems to be a trend to be reviewing last year.  I feel the peer pressure.  PRESSURE.  Here goes:</p>      <h3>Personally</h3>     <ul>        <li>Given how early my brithday is, I started off the year by turning 28.</li>        <li>I went to the gym -- more than once.  In fact, I went a whole lot (4-5 days/week) and it felt great.  Sometime in September, it fell apart and I stopped going.  Resolution for 2007 -- start going again.</li>        <li>My <a       href="https://www.lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2006/12/31/IMG_6687.jpg">youngest       daughter</a> was diagnosed with Alopecia Areata and has lost       about 50% of her hair.  Lisa and I are coping.  She's quite       adorable, so that makes things easier!</li>        <li>My grandfather passed away.</li>        <li>Lisa and I miscarried in January.</li>        <li>We're pregnant (we think with a girl) due May 21st.</li>        <li>Zoe started at Temple Isaiah pre-school and loves it.  She now is able to write several words all by herself.</li>        <li>I sold my childhood drumset (Vintage Premier) and bought a <a href="https://www.rolandus.com/Multimedia/Flash/vpro/index.html">Roland V-Pro TD20S kit</a>.  I can now play 100 different drumsets while the kids are sleeping.  (It's electronic).  I'm not all that good anymore, but I was thinking of starting a "Drumcast" as a variant to this whole Podcast craze.</li>        <li>I saw <a href="https://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2006/06/28/IMG_5627.jpg">Dublin</a>, Ireland, <a href="https://www.lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2006/06/28/IMG_5629.jpg">reaffirmed my faith</a> and saw some <a href="https://www.lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2006/06/30/IMG_5810.jpg">surrounding</a> <a href="https://www.lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2006/06/30/IMG_5788.jpg">areas</a>).

Damn       that's a good product :-)</li>        <li>While it was near the end of the year, I got a whole lot better at tracking       my time at work (how much time spent on each project).</li>        <li>For a long time, I felt like OmniTI was me.  I feel like our       staff are making OmniTI theirs.</li>      </ul>      <li>I participated in an absolutely enormous (and successful) <a     href="https://www.lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/66-Big-Bad-PostgreSQL.html">migration     from Oracle to PostgreSQL</a>.</li>      <li>I've had the opportunity to play quite a bit with <a     href="www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> and deployed several     architectures on <a     href="https://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris 10</a>.  It     has been a refreshing experience.</li>      <li>I spoke at two <a     href="https://entwickler.com/konferenzen/divers/psecom,id,333,nodeid,484.html">ApacheCons</a>     and an <a     href="https://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a>.</li>      <li>Met Bryan Cantrill and Adam Leventhal from the Sun kernel engineering team.     While I met them in 2005, I didn't quite realize how cool the stuff they were working on was.</li>      <li>I finished and published my book <a     href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067232699X/lethargy-20/104-9600898-8379162?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2">Scalable     Internet Architectures</a> in July.  For a small book, it is     densely packed with content and was a serious undertaking.</li>      </ul>
