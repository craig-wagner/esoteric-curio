In the unlikely event that I can actually focus enough to write in my blog, I have started a new blog with new software.  I don't much like Moveable Type and thought I'd give Serendipity a whirl.  <p>It is so hard to separate work from life.  Those parts of life that are clearly not work are hard to find time to write about... I hardly have time to live them.</p>  <p>Regardless, I thought it would be remiss to not make an attempt.</p>
