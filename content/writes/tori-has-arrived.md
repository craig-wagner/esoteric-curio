<p>We're all very excited to announce the newest addition to clan Schlossnagle.</p>  <p>Tori Eowyn Schlossnagle was born via Cesarean on May 15th at 12:35pm.  At birth she weighed 8 pounds 4.8 ounces and stretched to 21 inches.  Hospital stays are always exhausting, but the whole familary is back at home resting now.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.lethargy.org/gallery/jesus/shoot/Shoots/2007/05/15">Some pictures of our beautiful third daughter</a>.</p>
