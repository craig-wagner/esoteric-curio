I was very pleased to read an <a href="https://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/755">interview</a> with our very own <a href="https://omniti.com/people/person/laura_thomson">Laura Thomson</a> on <a href="https://devzone.zend.com/">Zend's DevZone</a>.  George and I have tried very very hard to make <a href="https://omniti.com/home">OmniTI</a> a great place to work -- it was one of the many things we wanted to "do right" after working at other companies that just didn't.  I'm really pleased that a recurring theme in the interview is how great it is to work at OmniTI.  I always thought I'd be proud of running a successful business (which I am immensely), but I find that I'm even more proud of running one that people like so much as an employer.
