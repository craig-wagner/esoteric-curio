<p>I am oft in the position where SCSI is not working right for me.  Whereas I <i>always</i> seem to be in the position where SATA over promises and under delivers.  When SCSI misbehaves, it usually really matters.  Where's my disk go?  Time outs?  And the king of all frustrations: wassup with that tape robot?!</p>  <p>This clearly puts me in the sysadmin geek category, but I had to share.  I had a spin-tingling euphoria when I read the details of SCSI packet sniffer written in dtrace. OMG this is cool: <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/chrisg/resource/scsi_d/scsi.d-1.12">https://blogs.sun.com/chrisg/resource/scsi_d/scsi.d-1.12</a>.</p>
