<p><a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> has been working with <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> for a while now on <a href="http://fontdeck.com/">Fontdeck</a>.  The super <a href="http://omniti.com/is/greg-chiasson">Greg Chiasson</a> has been pushing our beta live and I've been provisioning machines and setting up infrastructure just so you can read this web page in a nice sexy font... Nice... Sexy.</p>  <p>And yes, of course, fontdeck is powered by our friends: Apache, PostgreSQL, OpenSolaris, a bit of Linux here and there, a sprinkling of both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography and an ancient dialect of computer-speak called Perl.</p>
