It was a pleasure speaking at OSCON2005 on Wednesday on the topic of cross-vendor database replication approaches.  Many attendees requested that I put the slides online.  While there is a tremendous amount of commentary and critique that goes with the slides, I hope that they will be somewhat useful to a more general audience.  Alas, here they are:  <ul> <li><a href="https://www.omniti.com/~jesus/misc/DB Replication.pdf">DB Replication PDF</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.omniti.com/~jesus/misc/DB Replication.key.tgz">DB Replication Keynote stack</a></li> </ul>
