First, I'm an amateur.  But, I'm avid, regular, and profficient.  I smoke meat
because I like to eat the meats I smoke.  I smoke meat often, because I like
to do that often.

I've tried a wide variety of smokers and smoking techniques.  I have not,
though intend to do so in the future, tried an actual hanging smoke house.
I've used manual feed side boxes, Green Eggs, gas grills with cast-iron
chip boxes, and electric smokers.  So... what do I use?  I use a [Bradley
Vertical Electric Smoker](https://amzn.to/2Ag5IFg).  Many say this is
sacrilegious... too bad.  I lead a busy life and the Bradley is a reliable
work horse.  I do occassionally do something else as a one-off, but
day-to-day I trust my Bradley.

### Food

I'll occassionally update this post with anachronistic links to future
recipes around smoking things... and they might even be dishes that
aren't meat!
