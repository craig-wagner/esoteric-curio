<p>Success with Tilapia!</p>  <p>I like Tilapia.  Frankly, it's probably one of my favorite white fish.  However, there a only a few recipies that I like to do at home that are reliable.  This past Friday night, I was tired and impatient and wanted to try something more risky and it was perfect.  Here we go.. adapt as necessary:</p>  <ul> <li>Take three filet of Tilapia of good size (total of about 1lbs). They should be ice-cold, almost frozen.</li>  <li>Thoroughly cover both sides of each filet with Moroccan dry run, I used <a href="https://www.madeinnapavalley.com/GR_MM2.shtml"</a>.  Put about 1tbs of olive oil in a non-stick skillet and heat on high for a pan searing.</li>  <li>Sear thoroughly on each side (90 seconds) so that both sides are crispy.</li>  <li>Place the filets on a broiler pan and crush blue corn tortilla chips and sprinkle the crumbs on the top side -- one heaping handful of uncrushed con-chips per filet.</li>  <li>Apply about 0.5 to 1 tbs of lime juice on top of the crushed chip.</li>  <li>Bake for approximately 14 minutes at 350 (or until done).</li> </ul>  <p>I served this on a bed of rice.  It was awesome.</p>
