<p>For those that don't yet know, we bought <a href="https://www.brainbulb.com/">Brain Bulb</a>.  <a href="https://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060516/20060516005161.html?.v=1">Read the acquisition press release</a>.  Chris joining our team is another stepping stone on our path to utter world domination -- don't say I didn't warn you.  I know. I know.  Terms like "unstoppable superpower" are so over-used these days.  Alas, I have great expectations and our evil plans are taking shape. <i>Whahahahahahaha</i>.</p>
