<p>A great success occurred for the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd project</a> today.  A month ago at ApacheCon I presented my "Apache Projects on DTrace" talk where I presented some <a href="http://lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/137-DTrace-and-Apache.html">magic mojo around a DTrace enabled Apache httpd</a>.  A few days ago <a href="http://journal.paul.querna.org/">Paul Querna</a> invested the time to putback some of the patch set required to make this go.  The <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200812.mbox/raw/%3C4938A57D.6050109@force-elite.com%3E/">code is all in</a>, just a bit of build magic remains to utilize the parts.  Hopefully we can work to put that part back soon.  Paul, I know your time is scarce and valuable, many thanks for the effort!</p>
