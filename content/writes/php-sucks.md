<p> So, at OSCON, I gave a PHP Lightning talk called "Six Reasons PHP Sucks."  It really deserves to be a slideshow with commentary, but I don't know how to do that really easily and I'm pretty lazy when it comes to that.  So, the slides aren't nearly as funny without my insane ranting to go along with it, but I figured that people that attended would at least have clear fond memories of it if the slides were available. </p> <p> I made a <a href="http://images.omniti.net/omniti.com/~jesus/misc/PHP%20Sucks.pdf">Six Reasons PHP Sucks</a> PDF file out of it using KeyNote so that the transitions are (sorta) preserved. </p>
