<p>These are vibram five fingers:</p>  <img src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2010/05/23/IMG_0837.jpg" width="580px"/>  <p>However, I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndactyly">syndactyly</a> affecting both of my feet.</p>  <p>I love the idea of having my toes separated which is why I prefer barefoot so much more than shoes.  Vibram five fingers have always appealed to me. However, I cannot wear them.  I wrote Vibram and asked for a pair of shoes to cut up and make acceptable for all the people with toes like mine, but they seemed completely uninterested.</p>  <p>This weekend, I finally took the risk and bought shoes I cannot even try on.  And here is my short, simple and successful journey.</p>  <p>First I cut down the side walls between the second and third toes. I trimmed the fabric a few millimeters from the rubber sole and about four millimeters from the top seam (where grey meets black).  Stopping here gives me wearable shoes that would collect rocks and offer a separation of the sole between the second and third toes that would be quite uncomfortable to walk in after a while.</p>  <img src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2010/05/23/IMG_0839.jpg" width="580px"/>  <p>The next part lack photography as the working space was very small and I couldn't take any solid pictures.  However, I used grey embroidery thread to loop-stich the two toe soles together from the inside leaving the bottom attached:</p>  <img src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2010/05/23/IMG_0841.jpg" width="580px"/>  <p>Then I did my best at a plait stitch (which I'll admit I did poorly) across the top of the toes from seam to seam:</p>  <img src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2010/05/23/IMG_0840.jpg" width="580px"/>  <p>And then I can slip my darling feet into them:</p>  <img src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2010/05/23/IMG_0842.jpg" width="290px"/><img src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2010/05/23/IMG_0843.jpg" width="290px"/>  <p>All in all, this took about an hour for the first shoe and about a half hour of the second shoe.  I'm pleased.  It turned out well.  These are my Vibram "syndactyly-enabled" Four Fingers. </p>
