The CFPs have been rolling in for Surge 2011; these are exciting times.  It does, however, appear that our description of what we're looking for has produced a different set of submissions that what I expected.  I think it might help to better understand what sessions were like last year and, luckily, we'll be [releasing all of the Surge 2010 video footage this week](https://omniti.com/surge/2010/sessions).  I apologize for the poor audio quality, we intend to pull in A/V recording professionals this year.

We've received some great proposals!  However, a surprising amount of them are presentations about products.  This conference is about problems and their solutions.  It is a conference for practitioners by practitioners.  Blood... in the mud.  I want to (as we did last year) share our struggles for better collective experience.

Emphasis: _Accepted proposals will demonstrate real-life scalability challenges and creative solutions. We love case studies and learning from our mistakes._

As such, with this context, I'm extending the [Surge 2011 CFP](https://omniti.com/surge/2011/cfp) deadline to April 17th.
