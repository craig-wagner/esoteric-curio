<p>Okay, it's not quite Goulash, but I'll call it what I want.  If you want it red, add some paprika.</p>  <p>I made this the other night and it worked well for me.</p>  <h3>Glaze:</h3>  <ul> <li>1/2 cup of rice wine vinegar</li> <li>2 tbsp of honey</li> <li>1/3 tbsp of lemon juice</li> </ul>  <p>Bring to boil and reduce to coat the back of a spoon.</p>  <h3>Goulash</h3>  <ul> <li>1 red onion chopped large</li> <li>6 cloves are garlic shredded or pressed</li> <li>3 jalepenos sliced (seeds in)</li> <li>2 thai chilis sliced (seeds in)</li> <li>3 table spoons of vegetable oil</li> </ul>  <p>Sweat the the above until onions loose their sharpness (not yet translucent).  Immediately add:</p>  <ul> <li>4 cups of assorted exotic mushrooms (shitake and others to liking)</li> </ul>  <p>Cook until mushrooms take on juices and onions are translucent.  Immediately add:</p>  <ul> <li>1 lbs of 26-30 count shrimp, pealed, tails off</li> </ul>  <p>Once shrimp are pink evenly add glaze. Cook until shrimp are done (30 seconds or so past pink).</p>  <p>Enjoy!  It has some bite.</p>
