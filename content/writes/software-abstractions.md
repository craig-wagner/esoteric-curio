A few years back, I presented on a topic near and dear to my heart: software abstractions.

I think it is critically important to take a pragmatic and critical view of software abstractions and I feel
this well represents my views.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I did sharing it with the wonderful audience at CraftConf.
