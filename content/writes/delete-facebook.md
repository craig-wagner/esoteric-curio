For a long time, I've seen my peers, my loved ones, and myself dump valuable time into the Facebook platform.
I've also seen it cause a lack of mindfulness.  I have long thought that I should use it less to regain some
enjoyment readily available elsewhere in my life.  As an excuse, I've said I need it for work, for family, or
just to stay connected to various communities.  The recent #deletefacebook trend has caused me to reflect and
rearticulate why I cannot simply delete Facebook.  I was unable to do so, so I deleted myself from Facebook.

This is far less about the misuse of data or the manipulation that platform is able to orchestrate.  I'd be
naive to think that isn't happening on swathes of other technology I use.  This comes down to me wanting to
do it for a long time and forcing myself to realize I had no legitimate excuses.  Let's see how this goes.
