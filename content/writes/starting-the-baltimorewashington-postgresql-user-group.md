<p>On the second Wednesday of every month, the Baltimore/Washington PostgreSQL User Group will meet at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=7070+Samuel+Morse+Dr,+Columbia,+MD+21046&jsv=107&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=42.03917,64.335938&ie=UTF8&ll=39.17033,-76.807995&spn=0.040325,0.062828&t=h&z=14&iwloc=addr">7070 Samuel Morse Drive, Ste 150 in Columbia, Maryland</a>.  Meetings start at 6:30pm and go until around 8:30pm.  I am pretty excited about this and pleased to offer up OmniTI's facilities for this.  I'm excited about the opportunity to share what I've learned, educate and grow the PostgreSQL community and learn from others in it.  This is going to be "good stuff."</p>  <p>Our first meeting will be held on May 14th, 2008.  Mark your calendars.  Also, subscribe to the mailing list at: bwpug@postgresql.org.</p>
