<p>So, there's this really neat little conference being run by <a href="https://percona.com/">Percona</a>.  It's in the Santa Clara Convention Center on April 22nd and 23rd.  If you are in the bay area, you should come check it out.  It's *free* and the <a href="https://conferences.percona.com/percona-performance-conference-2009/schedule.html">speakers list is simply smashing</a>.</p>  <p>I'll be giving a talk on a largish PostgreSQL install that happens to be on Solaris on ZFS.  So, interesting stuff all around.</p>  <p>I don't make it out to California that often, so if you want to catch me -- that'd be a good time.  See you there!</p>
