<p>Call to action!  Make the web a faster place!  Here's a short <a href="https://omniti.com/seeds/yslow-to-yfast-in-45-minutes">article on how I spent 45 minutes to improve user-perceived performance</a> on <a href="https://omniti.com/">our website</a>.  This is the low-hanging fruit of front-end web performance optimizations.</p>  <p>Most of you who read my blog are scalability or performance nuts.  Most of you also cast the majority of your focus (like me) on the back-end infrastructure problems.  Don't ignore the front-end when just a tiny bit of work can remove a huge amount of suck.</p>  <p>If everyone takes these steps, the web will be a more enjoyable place to visit.</p>
