<p>I was just surfing <a href="https://planetpostgresql.org/">Planet PostgreSQL</a> and read <a href="https://www.chesnok.com/daily/2008/03/26/postgresql-conference-east-this-saturday-and-sunday/">Selena Deckelmann's blog post</a> that said the 2008 PostgreSQL Conference East is this Saturday and Sunday.  My first response was, "WTF? I though it was like two weeks away and on a Thursday and Friday."  My second response was, "I'm speaking at that, I should go."  My third though?  <strong>You should go too.</strong></p>  <p>So... I, like any professional speaker, finished my slides on time and turned them in several weeks ago.  I have a polished presentation that's going to kick major ass.  If you are in the area (Baltimore/Washington), you should definitely come down and partake in the festivities that surround <a href="https://postgresql.org/">the most advanced open-source database</a> in the <strong>universe</strong>.  I might even through in a few <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/">Hot Fuzz</a> quotes during my presentation.</p>
