<p> Signing on from <strikethrough>sunny</strikethrough> <strikethrough>rainy</strikethrough> sunny Austin, TX at this years <a href="http://www.us.apachecon.com/">ApacheCon US</a>.  On Monday I gave my usual <a href="http://omniti.com/talks/Scalable200610/show">Scalable Internet Architectures talk</a> which went well.  This time I put my slides online in a web slide-show which works rather nicely.  Note that it is 27MB of images making up 352 slides (including transitions). </p>  <p> ApacheCon tutorials are hard to describe.  Attendance is not enormous and people often question if they should attend.  My answer is complicated and while I find it hard to explain, I think I managed an excellent "opinion" of ApacheCon tutorials in <a href="http://feathercast.org/podcasts/feathercast_ep14.mp3 ">the most recent feathercast</a>.  It's positive and a good representation of what to expect at ApacheCon Tutorials!  Attend next year! </p>  <p> Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention <a href="http://omniti.com/people/jobs">we're hiring</a> as I have mentioned it about 1000 times since I got here. </p>
