<p>So, I'm sitting here in the living room of our cottage rental (quite nice). What's better?  I show up and my slick wireless network detector lights up before I'm in the house.  SID=Motorola and no password -- sweet.  It's fast and convenient and <b>free</b>.</p>  <p>So, I hop online and surf the web, but then I try to ssh somewhere and I find that they are blocking all ports but 80, 443, and 25.  So, port blocking is really annoying, but WTF?! would you leave 25 open.  What are they saying, I can't ssh somewhere (or check my mail via IMAP or POP3), but I can spam the world?  Beyond stupid.</p>  <p>Turns out that my PPTP-based VPN works like a charm and the connectivity is good to the office, so life is fine.  But why a provider would block ports and <b>not</b> block port 25 is just beyond my comprehension.  Sad.</p>
