<p>Two weeks ago was a whirlwind.  I thought I'd catch up last week and blog about it, but it was so taxing that my fatigue combined with three germ monsters at home resulted in a severe cold that knocked me out.</p>  <h4>The 8th</h4>  <p>4:28am Amtrak BWI to NYP.  I had the privilege and honor of visiting <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=ps0&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=club+101+NY&amp;fb=1&amp;view=text&amp;latlng=2452034502024788935">Club 101</a> in New York, NY to speak to the <a href="https://newyorkcto.blogspot.com/2007/05/new-york-cto-club.html">New York CTO Group.</a>  I spoke on the topics of (you guessed it) scalability and performance in Internet applications.  I did my best to integrate some thoughts on cloud computing into the discussion.  As is typical with a short time frame and a first presentation -- I have a lot of things I'd change.  For one, I believe I came across as far too negative toward cloud computing.  I considered the amount of published hype around cloud computing and I wanted to provide a reality check.  Many thinks to Geir Magnusson and Igor Shindel.  This was a truly wonderful experience and I can only hope that the audience was as impressed with me as I was with them.</p>  <h4>The 9th</h4>  <p>6:50am flight from BWI to BUF.  I went on-site with <a href="https://omniti.com/is/ciprian-tutu">Ciprian</a> to a client in Buffalo.  Various documents prevent me from discussing any details.  Suffice it to say, it is an interesting problem and truly challenging technical and business problem solving on a day-to-day basis.  The point?  I leave there tired.  Heading back two days this coming week.</p>  <h4>The 10th through the 12th</h4>  <p>2:30pm Amtrak from BWI to NYP.  <a href="https://omniti.com/is/jason-dixon">Jason Dixon</a> and I went to <a href="https://www.nycbsdcon.org/2008/">NYCBSDCON</a>.  I had a speaking engagement on Sunday morning to reveal (first public presentation of) <a href="https://labs.omniti.com/trac/reconnoiter/">Reconnoiter</a>.  I think it went really well.  I enjoyed meeting a lot of new people with different perspectives.  It was an interesting crowd and a refreshing experience.  Being as tired as I was and around so many chain smokers made me ill on Sunday -- that was no fun.</p>  <h4>Last week.</h4>  <p>I was hoping I could catch up on things last week.  I'm preparing for a lot of action on the Buffalo front, a new person is starting (tomorrow) that will head up OmniTI's internal accounting and I toured many office spaces in search of new offices for the <a href="https://omniti.com/is">ever growing OmniTI</a>.  Running <a href="https://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> takes pretty much all of my time away from home.  I need to learn that adding more things just hurts.</p> <p>Murphy certainly had his sights on me.  I promised my wife I'd take a day of much needed vacation on Friday.  I managed to get sick on Thursday which climaxed on Saturday morning.  On top of that, I did my business real-estate tour on Friday morning -- my sick vacation day.  I think I need a do-over.</p> <p>Last night, I finally started to feel better.  I'm sure the bottle of (local) La Grange Norton red wine and the outdoor fire (thanks Katherine!) helped a lot.</p> <p>Oh yeah... In two weeks I'll be in New Orleans at <a href="https://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2008/">ApacheCon</a>!  I hope to see you there!</p>
