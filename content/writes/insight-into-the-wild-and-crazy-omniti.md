<a href="http://webpulp.tv"><img src="/~jesus/uploads/webpulp-snap.jpg" width="200" height="149" style="float:right; margin:0em 1em"/></a><p>I recently had the privilege of being interviewed by Josh Ownes over at <a href="http://webpulp.tv">Webpulp.tv</a> about all sorts of things.  It's rare that I get time to sit down and think about all the crazy stuff we do at <a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> let alone talk about it.  Aside from a camera angle that is quite odd and very poor picture quality, the interview is really nice.  While I typically don't watch or listen to my own media events (it's eerie), in this interview I actually enjoyed listening from start to end because it is a fairly fun list of wild and crazy things we to at OmniTI in unconventional depth.</p>  <p>Almost everything Josh and I talk about happened this year!  And it's only half over!  2010 is really the "year of awesome" for innovation at OmniTI.  We did cheat a bit by having several exciting things hidden in the oven nearing the end of 2009.</p>  <p>If you want to know what I do and what OmniTI does on a daily basis, I think <a href="http://webpulp.tv/post/816582386/omniti-theo-schlossnagle">this interview gives a lot of insight</a>.</p>
