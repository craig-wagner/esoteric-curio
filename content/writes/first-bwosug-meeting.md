<p>I'm excited to announce the first ever BWOSUG meeting. On March 11th we'll be meeting up for the first time to geek-out on OpenSolaris technologies. To break of from the dry tradition of blind zealotry, we're going to shake things up a bit:</p>  <p>I've found that there's no true appreciation for technology like pain and suffering. As such, we'll be telling war stories of bugs encountered, havoc caused and work arounds applied. This meeting should get quite a few people talking and hopefully be very educational.</p>  <p>Join us at the OmniTI offices at 6:30pm on March 11th, 2009!</p>  <pre> OmniTI 7070 Samuel Morse Dr. Ste 150 Columbia, MD 21046 </pre>
