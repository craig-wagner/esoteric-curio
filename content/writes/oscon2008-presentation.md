<p>Hello from OSCON.  I gave my full-stack introspection crash course talk today.  It has been quite a while since I've presented anything in a 40 minute format, but I think the talk went quite well.  I got a lot of positive feedback.</p>  <p>I decided to take a risky approach inspired by <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/DTrace/dtrace.conf">dtrace.conf(08)</a> by demonstrating dtrace on a live, mission-critical system we run at <a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a>.  The risks of this are: network connections flake out, dtrace doesn't work correctly or I do something stupid and cause some service unavailability.  Well, as I use dtrace just about every day, I wasn't worried about the breaking things.  And while my network connection winked out for about one minute and dtrace has some <a href="http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?messageID=10099871">annoying <b>sub-second</b> aborts</a>, I think the demonstration was quite effective.</p>  <p>Many people gave positive commentary at the end and afterward.  People asked for the slide to be put online... and while they have no real content of value (as the demo was everything), I put them here anyway:</p>  <div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_526241"><a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/guestaeae3b/oscon2008-fullstack-introspection-crash-course?src=embed" title="OSCON2008 Full-stack Introspection Crash Course">OSCON2008 Full-stack Introspection Crash Course</a><div class="youtube-video"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=oscon2008-1216885292078669-8"> </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> </param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"> </param><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=oscon2008-1216885292078669-8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"> </embed></object></div><div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;">view <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/guestaeae3b/oscon2008-fullstack-introspection-crash-course?src=embed" title="View OSCON2008 Full-stack Introspection Crash Course on SlideShare">presentation</a> (tags: <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://slideshare.net/tag/oscon">oscon</a> <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://slideshare.net/tag/dtrace">dtrace</a>)</div></div>  <p>In addtion to the slide stack, I've included the simple scripts that I used during the demonstration.  I ran <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/qps.d">qps.d</a>, <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/query_speed.d">query_speed.d</a>, and <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/query_speed2.d">query_speed2.d</a> on the database server and <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/r3.sh">r3.sh</a>, <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/perl.d">perl.d</a>, <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/pcpu.d">pcpu.d</a>, <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/papcpu.d">papcpu.d</a>, and <a href="/~jesus/misc/oscon2008/papcpu2.d">papcpu2.d</a> on the web server.  These require The Devel::DTrace perl module, <a href="http://labs.omniti.com/trac/project-dtrace/browser/trunk/postgresql">PostgreSQL patches</a>, and <a href="http://labs.omniti.com/trac/project-dtrace/browser/trunk/apache22">Apache 2.2.8 patches</a>.  Some of them are approximations of correctness, so weigh the output appropriately (the perl ones).  Enjoy!</p>
