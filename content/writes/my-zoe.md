I love the camera because of its portabliity, but the lack extensive optics make it hard to take spectacular pictures.  However, when the lighting is just right...  <p>Zoe's 21 months old now and talking up a storm now -- every once in a while we here a structured sentence.  She clearly knows what she wants and what she wants to say.  It is quite interesting to see her struggle with oration.</p>  <p>Zoe is beginning to understand that her future sibling is en-womb and that Lisa will continue to get bigger.  I think Zoe will be very excited once she understands what being a big sister is all about.</p>
