<p>DTrace kicks ass.  Everyone knows I love ZFS, but in my opinion DTrace is the most significant and disruptive systems technology in at least 10 years.</p> <p>Today I gave my talk at ApacheCon; it was well received.  I hope that I inspired some people to go use DTrace and look in their systems' underpants.</p> <p>Here are <a href="https://lethargy.org/~jesus/misc/d1.pdf">my slides</a> and <a href="https://labs.omniti.com/trac/project-dtrace/browser/trunk/apache22">the scripts</a> I used for my live demo.</p> <p>I'll update this entry with the video as soon as I have the link.</p> <p>I mentioned a Linux port underway.  I got the name wrong when I talked about it (sorry Paul!).  The person working on the port is Paul Fox, the author of the CRiSP editor.  For more information, check out <a href="https://www.crisp.demon.co.uk/blog/index.html">his blog</a>.</p>
