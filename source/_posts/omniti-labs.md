<p>So, as many of you may already know, open source is "good stuff."  It has a foothold in almost every industry, from manufacturing to accounting to retail to portable electronics to "the dot com."</p>  <p><a href="http://omniti.com/home">OmniTI</a> services a wide variety of clients that use both open source and closed source technology and if you've ever heard me speak on the subject I usually go on a rant about "open source as a religion sucks."</p>  <blockquote> &lt;rant&gt;<br /> Open source is great; it has benefits; it has costs; more often than not those benefits outweigh the costs by a significant amount.  However, if you are religious about using open source you start focusing on the solution set before you define the problem set.  Technology is a <b>tool</b> to help solve non-technology problems and make businesses grow and consumers happy.  Sometimes closed sourced solutions have more benefit than cost when compared to open source technologies, sometimes not -- let the problem decide.<br /> <br /> Have faith that the critical analysis of a problem will most often lead you to an open source solution anyway.<br /> &lt;/rant&gt; </blockquote>  <p>Despite the fact that we embrace closed source and open source alike, it remains a truth that we see well over 99% of client architectures solidly in the open source realm (up from about 95% five years ago).  Suffice it to say, open source enables OmniTI to build better solutions for clients.  Period.</p>  <p>OmniTI, for a long time now, has boasted a staff that participates heavily in the open source communities such as <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, and now even <a href="http://opensolaris.org/">OpenSolaris</a> (just to name a few).  And, since inception, OmniTI has always encouraged contributing changes back to improve the code that we use, etc. etc.</p>  <p>Many source communities shun corporate identities from participating and rely on individual meritocracy alone.  I don't believe this is bad or good, but I think it can (sometimes) be a bit short sighted.  Some companies (particularly consultancies like ours) really do live and breathe open source code.  This leads me to believe that the company itself (as a super-entity) has something to contribute in addition to the contributions of <a href="http://omniti.com/people">spectacular individuals</a> -- it can contribute <a href="http://labs.omniti.com/">OmniTI Labs</a>.</p>  <blockquote> "The success of our company is based on supporting businesses that run on Open Source software, so it is exciting for us to have a tangible way to contribute back to the community," said Theo Schlossnagle, principal of OmniTI. "OmniTI Labs provides a central repository for our developers to share the code theyâ€™ve written in the course of our work with the Open Source community. We look forward to seeing the content grow substantially over the coming months to become a go-to site for software developers as they look for ways to streamline their Open Source projects." </blockquote>  <p>I'm very excited about making <a href="http://labs.omniti.com/">OmniTI Labs</a> available and for <a href="http://omniti.com/people">all of us here at OmniTI</a> to have an avenue to release tools they develop that has an absolute minimum amount of red tape.  I expect this resource to flourish into an invaluable set of tools.</p>
