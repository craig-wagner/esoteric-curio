<p>It's been ages since I wrote about a book I've read.  I didn't stop reading, just sharing.</p>

<p>I recently read Jared Diamond's "Gun, Germs &amp; Steel."  I'm not going to spoil the book, but not for the reason you think.  You can't spoil this book without regurgitating it in its entirety: it is pure content.  Every page is interesting and I refreshingly exercised my mind on the challenges of our world from an old-world perspective.  If you've the time and patience (and haven't read it already), I highly recommend this book.  Plain and simple, it makes you think.  If you are like me (i.e. an entrepreneur or an engineer), you likely will think in atypical patterns.  Thinking differently means thinking smarter tomorrow.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>If you've read it, please let me know what you (as a fellow engineer) thought of this book.  Did you find it fascinating or is my head just malfunctioning?</p>
