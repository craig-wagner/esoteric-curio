<p>Every year my in-laws go to the Cape (Cape Cod, MA).  They manage to pull my wife who manages to pull me along for the ride.</p>  <p>It was pretty miserable until I finally convinced the clan that air conditioning wasn't a privilege but a requirement.  Now I kinda look forward to it every year, though not nearly as much as my wife.</p>  <p>11 hours in the car tomorrow with four adults and two children under the age of 3.  Yikes!  I hope it's worth it.</p>  <img style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://www.lethargy.org/theo/photodata///Family/Cape%20Cod%202004/320/DSC00404.JPG">
