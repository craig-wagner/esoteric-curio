<p>Today someone posted to the Wackamole list and asked for some detailed documentation of the configuration options and other such things.  I looked around for a bit and there is very little.  However, I knew that I had written some.</p>

<p>After some digging (and it took a while), I arrived at my ApacheCon 2002 US tutorial presentation.  Amazing when you get paid to do something it is usually quite thorough.  Anyway, 3 years later... here are is the tutorial slide stack.</p>
