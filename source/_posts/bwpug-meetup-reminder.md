<p>Hi all!</p>

<p>Just a friendly reminder that we'll be having our first meetup tomorrow as planned.  I thought as a good kick-off we could all collaboratively share what we do with PostgreSQL.  We'll start off with a whirlwind tour of how OmniTI uses PotsgreSQL, taking a brief look at ZFS, DTrace and large datasets.  After that I think it would be good to get to know each other -- maybe we'll hit a local pub afterwards!</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there!<p>

<blockquote>
Meetup starts at 6:30pm<br />

<p>If you have issues getting in the building, ring me on my cell -- it will be posted on the doors.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Theo</p>
