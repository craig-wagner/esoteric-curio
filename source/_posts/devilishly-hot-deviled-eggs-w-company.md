I got a copy of "The Sriracha Cookbook: 50 "Rooster Sauce" Recipes that Pack a Punch" last week.  First recipe today was just awesome.  The egg filling was a little loose, I think I'll back down the lime juice in the next batch of Sriracha Mayo.  Still. Pop!  Thumbs up.

I have some habanero stuffed olives (which make excellent spicy martini... below).  I think I'll half some of them and use that as garnish.

### Spicy Martini

1.  Tito's Handmade Vodka -- my personal favorite
2.  A sideways look of dry vermouth.
3.  A (small) splash of traditional Tabasco (mainly for the subtle hint of vinegar and color).
4.  2-3 tsp of olive brine (from the hab. stuff olives).

Shaken, then into a martini glass. 2 habanero stuff olived and a regular marini olive, alternating on the skewer.

Couldn't be simpler and is only one-upped by a Jalapeno Margarita.
