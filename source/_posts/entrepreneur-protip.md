I've seen various posts from a diaspora of "entrepreneurs" that have
resulted in nothing more than a cacophony of conflicting advice.  Some
of that advice was (in my opinion) bad.  What better way to fix this
than add my own!

I started by [first business](http://omniti.com/) in 1997 and then
proceeded to found [three](http://messagesystems.com/)
[other](http://fontdeck.com) [companies](http://www.circonus.com/).
I've been around a bit and understand the stresses of growing a
company from nothing (no funding) as well as from taking rounds of
financing and leveraging debt.

So... here's my advice. (hint: nothing to do with finance)

## 1. Understand how you cope with the stresses in your life.

You, like everyone else, have stresses and have to cope with them.  As
an entrepreneur of a growing business you are going to be exposed to
some very foreign and harsh stresses.  Understanding how you cope with
stress and having practiced techniques for doing so is pretty much the
only thing that will keep you focused, committed, and effective on
your journey.

## 2. Be prepared to work hard.

There’s a lot of talk about sleep deprivation and not enough talk
about 80 hour weeks and 3am calls.  The latter does not induce the
former.  Sleep deprivations is the dominion of those with bad time
management skills and poor discipline… oh, and new parents.  That
said, being a new parent during the high stress parts of building a
company puts a phenomenal amount of stress on both partners.

## 3. Be passionate.

There will be some hard times.  Other days will leave you feeling like
you had three meals of shit sandwiches.  If you don’t have a damn good
reason to pick yourself up tomorrow and reengage, you won’t. Passion
is that reason.  For many, passion is just the money and while that may
work, I find that it can be demoralizing to have that be the whole
picture… because success.

> back.

## 4. Be able to define success.

It doesn’t need to be articulated painstakingly in a contract, but you
need a firm and unshifting idea of what success looks like.  There may
be times where you need to reevaluate that definition, but the process
should be deliberate and from the ground up each time.  Shifting
definitions allow you to cheat yourself and yield less personal
reward.

> retrospectively quite proud of some of my accomplishments that
> didn't hit targets.  Some even took five years longer than I'd
> planned.

## 4. Take risks and don’t be afraid to fail.

When you do fail, don’t let yourself off the hook. Hold yourself
accountable and don’t excuse a future failure of like kind.  Be honest
with your customers and your staff about your failures and your bad
decisions.  We're all human (I think) and transparency is a powerful
trust builder.

> change and that lead to risk aversion or indecision, I'd always end
> up with less that I deserve.  When I'm betting on myself, I put my
> fucking chips on the table.

## 5. Be prepared to be wrong.

Humility is not required, but it sure fucking helps.  You’re going to
get a lot of shit wrong.  In fact, I’d wager you’re going to get most
of it wrong.  Neither arrogance nor selective memory turns that
learning experience into personal improvement.  Awareness,
introspection, and honesty do that and it’s dramatically easier to
leverage those character traits with a big fat dose of humility.

> (yes, I just said that). This also means I must surround myself
> with smart people with backbone that are capable of calling me out
> on my fuckups before it goes too far.

## 6. Lead.

A great entrepreneur, like a great leader, should inspire others into
their vision.  If you surround yourself with people to do your work
and lighten your load, you can grow and be good.  If you surround
yourself with people who are more capable than you, impassion them
with your vision and tie successful outcomes to their contributions,
you will succeed and be great.

> Sadly, the answer to that is "no" more often than I'd like.  Still,

That's it: take a deep breath, calm down, work your ass off,
appreciate your loved ones, take risks, be humble, and lead on to
greatness.
