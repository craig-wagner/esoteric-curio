There is something truly American about sitting around a grill, drinking beer for 6 hours while a hug pork butt or shoulder slowly falls apart over low heat.

Here's my recipe... as simple as it is.<br>
<ol>
<li>Get a big (6-8 lbs) pork shoulder.</li>
<li>Get a can of <a href="http://www.germandeli.com/szegedribrub.html">Szeged Rib Rub</a>.</li>
<li>Coat the shoulder with 3tbs or so of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
<li>Rub 1/3 to 2/3 of the can of rib rub into the meat.  Massage thoroughly -- love it man, love it.</li>
<li>But the relaxed shoulder into a gallon (or larger if needed) Ziplock bag and into the refrigerator for two hours.</li>
<li>... 1:45 elapse... </li>
<li>Get your grill hot (450 F)</li>
<li>Toss the shoulder on the grill fat side up... Close the lid and leave it for about 3 minutes</li>
<li>Roll it over to the other side and close it... Leave it for 2-3 minutes.  You need to keep a close eye on it here as you can get some wicked flare-ups from the fat back on the shoulder.</li>
<li>Put the now-seared shoulder into a disposable 8"x14" baking tin <b>FAT SIDE UP</b> (the fat will melt and it should drip <i>through</i> the meat).</li>
<li>Put 1tbs of Crisco<sup>TM</sup> shortening right on the top -- it will melt and help the rendering process start</li>
<li>Put a smoke box with wet hickory chips over heat on one side and the tin over no heat on the other side. Leave the lid open for about 5 minutes to get the temp down.</li>
<li>Cook for 5-6 hours between 250F and 290F.  Keep an eye on it (<i>i.e. drink alot</i>).</li>
<li>It should fall off the bone now... Pull it with two forks (like shredding it).</li>
</ol>
