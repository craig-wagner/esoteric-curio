<table width="100%"><tr><td><p><img height=300 width=200 src="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Shoots/2007/11/IMG_7500.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left:10px"> My daughter Gianna has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia_areata">Alopecia Areata</a> (more particularly Alopecia totalis).  She's bald -- completely.  She's three and just now she is beginning to become a bit self-conscious about her different appearance.  It's understandable... kids are cruel, no one (young) really likes to be different.  Lisa and I are exploring getting Gianna a nice wig to make her feel more like she fits.  For now, I shaved my head so she's not the only one bald in the house.  People have told me that they think what I did was awesome.  I thank you all for your encouragement, but it is very little sacrifice.  I really don't care what I look like -- I'm anything but vain when it comes to my appearance.  Thank Lisa, she's the one that has to look at me all the time! </p></td></tr></table>
