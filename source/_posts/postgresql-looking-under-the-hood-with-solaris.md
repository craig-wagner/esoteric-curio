<p>For those interested, here is my slide stack from PostgreSQL Conference East '08.  I think the title of the talk was "<a href="http://lethargy.org/~jesus/misc/PostgreSQLonSolaris.pdf">PostgreSQL: Looking under the hood with Solaris</a>."</p>

<p>The presentation was 90 minutes long and had lots of shell-based show-and-tell.  Obviously that stuff isn't available in the slides.  I think it went over quite well.  The audience was small, but hopefully people took away the a lasting impression of what DTrace has to offer and at least one person had the response: "By the power of Greyskull."  Regardless, enjoy the slides!</p>
