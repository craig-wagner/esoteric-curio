My colleague <a href="http://omniti.com/is/mark-harrison">Mark Harrison</a> at <a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> wrote a <a href="http://omniti.com/seeds/virtualization-zfs-and-zetaback">nice little piece on Solaris Containers (Zones)</a> and how we use them (a lot).  It's a short and simple read, good for psuedo-technical people that want to know a but more about Zones.
