title: Trying Windows, but it hurts

<p>So, I have this VAIO and it's pretty nice.  I have WinXP, FreeBSD 5.4, Solaris 10 and Linux RHFC 4 running on it.  Windows supports everything (of course).  Linux supports most things, but can't seem to ACPI suspect which makes it close to useless.  FreeBSD either.  Solaris doesn't have a wireless driver for the built-in controller, so it's pointless to run that.</p>  <p>But... I have VMWare, so I can run Windows and use all the features, and then boot VMs to rn each of my other OSes.  What's wrong with this?  Nothing in particular.  However, I do need to know how to use Win XP to accomplish this.  And therein lies the crux.  I have no Windows Kung-Fu.  ZERO.</p>  <p>So, I set about trying to learn about this Windows thing with a pretty open mind.  The vast majority of things I have trouble with are the shortcuts -- I just don't know them.  I've install some of the power tools, and that's helped a bit.  But, at the end of the day, things are just different and it hurts.</p>  <p>So... I need wireless drivers for Solaris and ACPI S1,2,3,4 suspend working... Or, I need linux ACPI suspend working.  This is just very awkward.</p>
