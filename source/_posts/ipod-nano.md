I just bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> for <a href="http://lisa.schlossnagle.org/">Lisa</a>.  The is, hands-down, the sexiest electronic device I've ever seen.  It makes my (not so old) iPod 40GB look like an anchor.  The thing is just gorgeous.

Very few technologies make me show my <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=O+FACE">O-face</a>.  For software, it's <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/">dtrace</a>.  For hardware, it's the Apple iPod nano.
