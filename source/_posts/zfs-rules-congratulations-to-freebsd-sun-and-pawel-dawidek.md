<p>I am very pleased to learn that shortly (a year or so) after Sun's opening of Solaris under the CDDL open source license that communities outside of the Sun/Solaris community are truly seeing benefit.  <a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=53604+0+current/freebsd-fs">Pawel Dawidek announced yesterday that ZFS is now in FreeBSD HEAD and will be available in 7.0</a>.  This is very exciting news.  We use ZFS and many of its advanced features extensively here at the <a href="http://omniti.com/">$DAYJOB</a> and I can say with authority that ZFS is damn cool juju.</p>

<p>We manage quite a few FreeBSD machines (in addition to Linux and Solaris).  It's good to know that some of the elegant solutions we've deployed on Solaris leveraging ZFS will now translate well to another platform we work with.</p>
