Yesterday I presented at ApacheCon 2003 in Las Vegas.  My talk on Scalable Internet Architectures was well received, but I have several complaint about the way things were done.

<p>There was no planning staff in the room.  I had to collect admittance passes myself.  I had no microphone.  Aside from the LCD projector, it was like teaching in a back alley.</p>

<p> Additionally, my presentation materials were not printed for the attendees of the tutorial session.  As it was a tutorial (cost extra), they opted not to place the presentation materials on the CDROM.  This means that the attendees had no way to take the information with them.</p>
<p>While my presentation was made in KeyNote (for Mac OS X), I did export it to PDF.  I do have some complaints about the KeyNote PDF export and PPT export features.  KeyNote supports a wonderful feature that allows images to me made partially transparent.  I use this to place a dark image on a white background, tone the image to 20% translucency and then place dark text over it.  While this technique as a nice professional touch to all the slides (and is completely readable), the export features make all incorporated images opaque.  So, the PDF has black text of dark images. YMMV.</p>
<p>Included below is the original keynote presentation and a (poor) PDF export of the same slides.</p>
