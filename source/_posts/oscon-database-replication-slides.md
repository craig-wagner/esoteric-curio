It was a pleasure speaking at OSCON2005 on Wednesday on the topic of cross-vendor database replication approaches.  Many attendees requested that I put the slides online.  While there is a tremendous amount of commentary and critique that goes with the slides, I hope that they will be somewhat useful to a more general audience.  Alas, here they are:

</ul>
