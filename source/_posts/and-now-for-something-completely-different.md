<p>It has been commonly said that all web applications are glorified guest books.  While we all know this not to be true, I think that this has evolved into a more recent conjecture that <em>most</em> web applications are glorified blogs.</p>

<p>Now, it takes between five and thirty minutes to set up a blog using one of the preexisting blog software packages out there.  Most of them are pretty straight forward as well.  So, if I said that one of the most complicated web apps I've seen in a long time is a blog, you'd likely laugh in my face.</p>

<p>Laugh away.</p>

<p>This site violates pretty much every rule of web UI design.  The content on the site is not information as much as it is a bunch of people arguing about current events and the righteousness of public opinion.  It's a blargument(TM).  Very strange.</p>

<p>I'm a bit biased, as it was developed here at the <a href="http://omniti.com/home">$DAYJOB</a>.  With respect to the technical side, there were a few intensely challenging aspects to the project.  As for the DHTML involved, to quote some old dude, "something wicked this way comes."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ctoads.com/">Take a look</a>, if you can survive the outright attack on the senses, it is clever and punchy on both the concept level and technical level.</p>
