<p><a href="http://netevil.org/">Wez Furlong</a> wrote an interesting piece on "seven thing" you may not know about him.  He singled me out... (er... sevened me out)... as someone he'd like to know seven things about.  I figured this would be a fun reflective journey down memory lane, so here goes...</p>
<ol>
<li>My good friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/6/b96/713">Aaron</a> gave me the nick-name <a href="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Misc/Theo-last-day-of-hair.jpg">Jesus</a> in college -- it stuck.  Though I've had many many hairstyles before and since (including the ever-popular flat top).</li>
<li>I studied <a href="http://ece.jhu.edu/">electrical engineering</a> at <a href="http://jhu.edu/">The Johns Hopkins University</a>, but accidently satisfied the requirements for a Bachelor of Science in <a href="http://cs.jhu.edu/">computer science</a> and was graduated without my E.E. degree.</li>
<li>I finished each of <a href="http://hcpss.org/hms/">middle school</a>, <a href="http://hcpss.org/ahs/">high school</a>, my <a href="http://jhu.edu">undergraduate degree</a>, and my <a href="http://cs.jhu.edu">graduate degree</a> one year sooner than expected.</li>
<li>I married <a href="http://lethargy.org/%7Ejesus/misc/Lisa1small.jpg">the love of my life</a> at the age of twenty.</li>
<li>I created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-29">MIG-29</a> flight game on Apple IIe when I was ten.  And the went to run my own BBS on my <a href="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Misc/theo_running_bbs.jpg">Packard Bell 286</a>.</li>
<li>I have bad circulation, so my feet are always cold... really, really cold.</li>
<li>I enjoy using my hands to create and change things.  Mostly home construction like renovations, landscaping (<a href="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Home/Backyard_Before_and_After/DSC00268.jpg">before</a> / <a href="http://lethargy.org/theo/photos/Home/Backyard_Done/IMG_7396.jpg">after</a>), etc.  My next career will be carpentry or landscaping.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm supposed to chain seven people that I'd enjoying know seven things about.  If figure that even if these people don't buy into this distraction, at least they'd be flattered that I thought of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.commandprompt.com/blogs/joshua_drake/">Joshua Drake</a>, a man on a mission not too different from my own</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/">Bryan Cantrill</a>, whose technology rocks my world</li>
<li><a href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett</a>, who never speaks of himself</li>
<li><a href="http://lisa.schlossnagle.org/">Lisa Schlossnagle</a>, who keeps me balanced (I really want to see the seven people to whom she chains)</li>
<li><a href="http://journal.paul.querna.org/">Paul Querna</a>, hacker extraordinaire</li>
<li><a href="http://www.david-reid.com/cynic/">David Reid</a>, who manages to hold a real (interesting) job outside of technology</li>
<li><a href="http://vireso.blogspot.com/">Sergey Ivanov</a>, who seems to have more interesting stories than a library</li>
</ul>
<p>and the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.</li>
<li>Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random, some weird.</li>
<li>Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.</li>
<li>Let them know they've been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or Twitter.</li>
</ul>
