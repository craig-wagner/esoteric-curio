<p><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>: all their base are belong to others.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/sleepycat/index.html">Oracle buys Sleepycat (BDB)</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/innodb/index.html">Oracle buys Innobase (InnoDB)</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.dbms2.com/2007/12/21/ibm-acquires-soliddb/">IBM acquire SolidDB</a></li> </ul>  <p>Unless you are running MyISAM (stop reading and switch now before you lose data)... the backend you run in MySQL has a product roadmap controlled by a competitor.  Think about that.</p>  <p>To be clear, I think this does not lessen MySQL's value today.  What it does is make me entirely unsure of MySQL's future value.  What's next? Luckily, I'm patients, so I'll just spectate.</p>
