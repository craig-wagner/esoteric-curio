## Personal

I was born in 1978 and was a military brat. My formative primary education took place in Howard County, Maryland. I skipped a few grades and in 1994 I matriculated to [The Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu/) where I started pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Physics; neither of which were achieved. In 1997, I received my B.S.E. in Computer Science and entered the Ph.D. program in the [Center for Networking and Distributed Systems](http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/). 1998 rolled around delivering me my M.S.E. in Computer Science where I focused on graphics and randomized algorithms in distributed systems.  I went on to research resource allocation techniques in distributed systems during four years of post-graduate work where in 2003 I was asked to leave the Ph.D. program, but that's a story is only told after you buy me a beer.

I started dating my future wife in 1995. We were quasi-high-school sweethearts. Note: I wasn't in high school. Four years later, we were married. Fun fact: we eloped, but most people at our wedding had no idea. Together [Lisa](http://lisabmrss.blogspot.com/) and I have three wonderful daughters.

I love food. In particular, I love meat. I thoroughly enjoy a great number of vices including fine [scotches, bourbons, whiskeys](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wYdaDTa5f-8/UqegttTscCI/AAAAAAAAEJw/qW50EE8LPf8/w691-h518-no/20131210_181515_LLS.jpg), beer, wine, cigars and bacon.

I practice Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu and Ninjutsu martial arts.


## Professional

After a very brief stint doing government contracting and watching my soul seep out through my pores, I quit and started my own business.

[My mother](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sherry-schlossnagle/1/70/450) and I founded [OmniTI](http://omniti.com/) in 1997 where I was the CEO for 17 years. Two years after starting OmniTI, I was joined by [my brother George](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/george-schlossnagle/0/449/a20). In 2008, we spun off a digital messaging company called [Message Systems](http://www.messagesystems.com/). In 2009 we started a company called [Fontdeck](http://fontdeck.com/) to bring richer typography to the web. In 2010, we spun off a company called [Circonus](http://www.circonus.com/) to change the world of systems montioring to be more data driven.

In 2014, I gave up my position as CEO at OmniTI to focus on Circonus.

## Industry

I sit on the [ACM Professions Board](http://learning.acm.org/about/professions_board.cfm) and the [ACM Queue Editorial board](http://queue.acm.org/editorialboardx.cfm).

I wrote a book on [Scalable Internet Architectures](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067232699X/lethargy-20/104-9600898-8379162?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link_code=xm2) and the first chapter of [Web Operations](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449377440/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449377440&linkCode=as2&tag=lethargy-20).

I've spoken at over 100 industry events and conferences; some of which are listed on my [Lanyrd speaking profile](http://lanyrd.com/profile/postwait/).
